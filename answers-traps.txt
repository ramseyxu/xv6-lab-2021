Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0,a1,a2(store 13)



Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
24:	4635                	li	a2,13
26:	45b1                	li	a1,12
compiler inserted the computation into code


At what address is the function printf located?
34:	608080e7          	jalr	1544(ra) # 638 <printf>


What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38 (next address of jalr printf)

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
He110 world
0x726c6400 for i if big-endian



In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
is the value of a2
